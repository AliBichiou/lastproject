        </strong>
        <p>The Health Ministry said on Wednesday that it will receive about one million doses from UK laboratories and
            one million doses from the US.

            These vaccines will arrive in early March, in addition to two million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

            Notably, Medical staff workers will be the first to receive the jabs.

            On Tuesday, the parliament adopted a bill authorizing Tunisia to join the global COVAX initiative for
            equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines.

            Meanwhile, Health Minister Faouzi Mehdi announced a decrease in the number of infections in the country but
            stressed the need to adhere to the health preventive measures.

            He pointed out that more than 400,000 Tunisians have registered to receive the vaccine, “which is a limited
            number compared to what Tunisia aspires to in terms of the number of vaccinated citizens.”

            This came as the Health Ministry reported 75 new Covid-19 deaths by Feb. 8, raising the death toll to 7,332
            since March 2020.

            It also recorded 811 new infections, raising the infection tally to 218,564.

                <h3 class="w">1.washing your hands </h3>
            </strong></p> <br>
        <p> Global Handwashing Day observed annually on October 15 to raise awareness and highlight the importance of
            handwashing as an effective means of disease prevention – this year marks a critical reminder for the world
            and the Region that this simple, cost effective practice can save lives.

            ‘Handwashing has always been one of most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that
            pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key
            cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention. Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19,
            hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we live through this
            pandemic, and beyond, to protect us from diseases,’ said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO
            South-East Asia Region.

            With COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated
            objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands
            with soap and running water is of critical importance. To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other
            COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or
            sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after
            handling animals or animal waste. Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles,
            or after one comes back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe.

            “Promoting hand hygiene at all levels of health care is also critical. Hand hygiene, a very simple action,
            is well accepted to be one of the primary modes of reducing health care-associated infection and of
            enhancing patient safety,” the Regional Director said.

            The pandemic is still among us and it is far from over. We must remind ourselves of the basics that we as
            individuals can do to keep ourselves safe, she said.

            This year’s Global Handwashing Day theme is Hand Hygiene for All and calls for all of society to achieve
            universal hand hygiene. To beat the virus today and ensure better health outcomes beyond the pandemic,
            handwashing with soap must be a priority now and in the future.

                <h3 class="w1">2.Wearing your mask</h3>
            </strong></p> <br>
        <img id="kmama" src="kmama.png" height="500px" width="500px">

        <h3 class="w2">Evidence for Effectiveness of Masks </h3>
        <p>Your mask helps protect those around you
            COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets travel into
            the air when you cough, sneeze, talk, shout, or sing. These droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of
            people who are near you or they may breathe these droplets in.

            Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others. Studies show that
            masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.

            You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people
            with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms
            (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you,
            in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.

            It is especially important to wear a mask when you are indoors with people you do not live with and when you
            are unable to stay at least 6 feet apart since COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact
            with one another. </p>
        </br>
        <h3 class="w3">Your mask offers some protection to you </h3>
        <p>
            A cloth mask also offers some protection to you too. How well it protects you from breathing in the virus
            likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (such as the type of fabric, the number of
            layers of fabric, and how well the mask fits). CDC is currently studying these factors.
        <h3 class="w4">Other Types of Face Protection</h3>
        <img src="bilar.png" id="bilar">
        <p>I personally do not recommend external icon using face shields or goggles as a substitute for masks. Goggles
            or other eye protection may be used in addition to a mask. Do NOT put a plastic face shield (or a mask) on
            newborns or infants.

            Face shields and goggles are primarily used to protect the eyes of the person wearing it. Goggles do not
            cover the nose and mouth. Face shields are not as effective at protecting you or the people around you from
            respiratory droplets. Face shields have large gaps below and alongside the face, where your respiratory
            droplets may escape and reach others around you and will not protect you from respiratory droplets from
            others. However, wearing a mask may not be feasible in every situation </p>
        <h3 class="w5">3.Avoiding crowded places</h3>
        <img src="https://www.hegghc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/social-distancing-covid19.png" height="250px"
            id="sdi" width="250px">
        <p> A better understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic responds to social distancing efforts is required for
            the control of future outbreaks and to calibrate partial lock-downs. We present quantitative relationships
            between key parameters characterizing the COVID-19 epidemiology and social distancing efforts of nine
            selected European countries. Epidemiological parameters were extracted from the number of daily deaths data,
            while
        <div id="symptoms"></div> mitigation efforts are estimated from mobile phone tracking data. The decrease of the
        basic reproductive number (R0) as well as the duration of the initial exponential expansion phase of the
        epidemic strongly correlates with the magnitude of mobility reduction. Utilizing these relationships we decipher
        the relative impact of the timing and the extent of social distancing on the total death burden of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <h3 class="w6">4.Symptoms</h3>
        <p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe
            illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have
            COVID-19:

            <br>Fever or chills <br> <strong>
                -Cough
                -Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing<br>

                -Muscle or body aches<br>
                -Headache<br>
                -New loss of taste or smell<br>
                -Sore throat<br>
                -Congestion or runny nose<br>
